//Here is an simple example with scope(), waveform() and spectrum() in the Mercury playground
//Try it out in flok.cc but without scope, waveform and spectrum because it doesn't work at present
//In flok open a hydra panel and copy/paste this: voronoi(10, ()=> m * 10).colorama(0.5).out(). The speed of voronoi will react with the mercury patch! Very cool to know it!
