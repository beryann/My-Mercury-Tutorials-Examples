Mercury Live Coding is a great program for creating your own musical and visual compositions (with Hydra Video Synth). The study of it led me to imagine my own examples by studying the tutorials offered in the Mercury homepage. 
These examples have been created as we go along, not necessarily respecting the initial order of these tutorials. However, I took care to indicate which tutorial it is in order to compare my example with that of the creator of Mercury -Timo Hoogland- 
I am not an expert in Github and more expert than me will be kind enough not to blame me too much for the presentation of these documents. Their help will be greatly appreciated if necessary.
In any case, help yourself and I hope you will like my contribution and help you!
