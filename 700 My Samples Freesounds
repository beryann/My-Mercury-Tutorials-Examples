// === TUTORIAL 700: Samples Freesound ===

//I asked to Timo Hoogland the creator of Mercury how to load soundfiles via links from Freesound ,so you have to do this in Freesound: 
//1) Go to the sound
//2) Right-click on the waveform
//3) Click "inspect"
//4) The Elements html window opens
//5) Search for the https://cdn.free.sound/org/something.mp3 file url
//6) copy and paste in the Mercury editor with that syntax: 

list s1 [ cello 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/251/251828_43-lq.mp3' ]
list s2 [ ryt 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/98/98098_1644663-lq.mp3' ]
list s3 [ ogg 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/33/33637_129090-lq.ogg' ]

//load the sounds 
set samples s1 s2 s3

//hear them 
new sample s1 time(1/4) speed(2) pan(random)
new sample s2 time(1/1) fx(delay)
new sample s3 time(1/1) gain(2)
